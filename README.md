# MonkeyDemo
OpenGL app of a spinning monkey head. Flying camera via WASD and SHIFT+SPACE.

Built using my game engine, Automata-Engine. https://github.com/BluBloos/Automata-Engine

# Steps for Building

This project depends on my game engine, Automata-Engine. You can find that here: https://github.com/BluBloos/Automata-Engine

The engine has its own dependencies, but the TLDR is:
- this project only works on Windows
- install Python and make sure its on your PATH
- install MS Visual Studio 2022, community ed. and ensure it is located at "C:\Program Files"

Here are the steps to build and run the app:

```bash
build.bat
bin\AutomataApp.exe
```
